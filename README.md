# ProudLock
Be proud of that lock

-----

ProudLock enables the Face ID latch glyph, internally called SBUIProudLockIconView, on older devices. Does not support iPhone X, because it already has the Face ID latch glyph.

**Compatibility**
* iPhone (except iPhone X)
* iPad

*Requires iOS 11 and Touch ID*

### Known Issues
* Seems there aren't any game-breaking bugs right now
